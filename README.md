# reinforcement-learning-algorithms

A sandbox with my own implementations of well-known reinforcement learning algorithms.

So far:
- [q-learning](./q-learning) using linear function approximation (using linear regression and gradient descent to improve the "ordering" of state's best actions)
- In progressâ€¦ q-learning using a non-linear approximator (neural network) for approximating the action values
